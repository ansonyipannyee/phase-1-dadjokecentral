# Dad Joke Central

Welcome to my very first Single-Page Application demo. 
This is my very own interpretation of AcademyXi's Phase One project which required us to build an app that must run on a single page while also demonstrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. 

In my project, I sought to delve into the world of dad jokes. Using the internet's largest selection of dad jokes provided by icanhazdadjoke.com, my project allows for users to search for jokes using specific keywords, generate random jokes with the click of a button, and stay updated with fresh content through our 'Dad Joke of the Day' function.
