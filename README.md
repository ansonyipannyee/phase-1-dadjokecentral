# Dad Joke Central

Welcome to my very first Single-Page Application demo. 
This is my very own interpretation of AcademyXi's Phase One project which required us to build an app that must run on a single page while also demonstrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. 

In my project, I sought to delve into the world of dad jokes. Using the internet's largest selection of dad jokes provided by icanhazdadjoke.com, my project allows for users to search for jokes using specific keywords, generate random jokes with the click of a button, and stay updated with fresh content through our 'Dad Joke of the Day' function.

# Features
1. Single-Page Application (SPA): 
My project is designed as a single-page application as it all runs on a single HTML page without redirects or page reloads, providing the user a seamless interface.

2. HTML/CSS/JS Frontend: 
I've created the frontend of my application using HTML for the structure of my content, CSS for my styling and layout, as well as JavaScript for interactivity and to fetch data from a public API (icanhazdadjoke.com).

3. Event Listeners:
I've implemented at least three distinct event listeners with different types which allow for various interactive features within my application.

4. Audio Integration:
I've intergrated audio into my application, providing users with an on-theme auditory experience when generating random jokes.

5. Additional Features:
I've incorporated the use of other design platforms in order to construct a logo to further improve the layout of my application.
